## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```
SplashScreen
    │
    ├── restoreSession() succeeds → MainShell (Home)
    │
    └── No saved session
         │
         ├── OnboardingScreen → CreateAccountScreen
         │                          │
         │                          ▼
         │                   EmailVerificationScreen (OTP)
         │                          │
         │                          ▼
         │                   EmailVerifiedScreen → MainShell
         │
         └── SignInScreen
                  │
                  ├── Stored verified session → MainShell (skip OTP)
                  │
                  └── New session → EmailVerificationScreen (OTP)
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                  EmailVerifiedScreen → MainShell
```

**OTP Testing:** During development, the generated OTP is printed to the debug console:
```
AquaSense OTP for user@example.com: 48271
```

## 📁 Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lib/main.dart` | App entry point — providers, routes, theme |
| `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart` | Centralised colours, text styles, and ThemeData |
| `lib/core/constants/app_routes.dart` | All named route strings |
| `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` | Full auth lifecycle with OTP and session persistence |
| `lib/providers/sensor_provider.dart` | Sensor CRUD, wizard state, per-screen search |
| `lib/repositories/sensor_repository.dart` | Abstract repo + mock implementation |
| `lib/models/sensor_model.dart` | Sensor domain model with enums and form classes |
| `lib/screens/home/main_shell.dart` | Bottom navigation shell with 4 tabs + AI FAB |

## 🧪 Testing

> Tests are not yet implemented. To run the test suite once tests are added:

```bash
# Unit and widget tests
flutter test

# Integration tests
flutter test integration_test/
```

## 📝 Design Decisions

1. **Provider over Riverpod** — chosen for simplicity and team familiarity; the abstract repository pattern makes migration straightforward if needed.
2. **Mock-first development** — all data sources are mock implementations behind abstract interfaces, allowing UI development to proceed independently of backend work.
3. **Per-screen search scoping** — `SensorSearchScope` enum ensures the Home and Sensors tab searches are independent.
4. **Scoped ChatProvider** — instantiated per `AiChatScreen` session (not global) so each conversation starts fresh.
5. **Centralised theming** — no raw `Color(0x...)` literals in widget files; every colour and text style lives in `app_theme.dart`.
